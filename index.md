<h2>static site generation with github pages documentation and step-by-step</h2>

<ol>"Static v Dynamic Website Design. ... A static site is one that is usually written in plain HTML and what is in the code of the page is what is displayed to the user. A dynamic site is one that is 
written using a server-side scripting language such as PHP, ASP, JSP, or Coldfusion."</ol>

<ol><i>github pages is a resource to (free) users of github, and will host one site associated with the account. github pages only hosts static sites.</i></ol>

<ol>github is version control software usable in terminal or gui. it's useful for tracking (and reverting) development as a collaboration tool</ol>

<ol>github deployment: creating a local directory containing all the files for the website (origin) and using command line inputs to (a) design the website (gaining exp with terminal: filesystem manipulation) and implementing github lessons learned from codecademy.com</ol>

<h2>background: foundational git skills gained from <a href="www.codecademy.com">codecademy.</a></h2>
<p>codecademy is simply a resource i found to be helpful in learning how to use git in terminal.
research is key. man pages, --help, and google searches prove invaluable in the pursuit of
programming help. perhaps most useful was repeating the lessons, and taking notes.</p>

<h2>common git commands and expressions used in this sitedev</h2>
<ol>git add --all</ol>
<ol>git commit -m "<i>type a short reference summary here</i>"</ol>
<ol>git push origin master</ol>

<h2>disclaimer: this site is to help implement and document my dev skills for
	later reference and process improvement.
	i dont pretend to be proficient enough to have others reference my documentation.
